	abstract = {We demonstrate how simple local sensing and control rules achieve$\backslash$nuseful emergent behaviors in modular self-reconfigurable (metamorphic)$\backslash$nrobots. Our biologically inspired approach grows structures with the$\backslash$ndesired functionality even though the final shapes have some unspecified$\backslash$nrandom variation. By contrast, other self-reconfiguration algorithms$\backslash$nrequire an a-priori exact description of a target shape for the given$\backslash$ntask, which may be difficult when a robot operates in uncertain$\backslash$nenvironments. We present and evaluate several control algorithms through$\backslash$nsimulation experiments of Proteo, a metamorphic robot system},
