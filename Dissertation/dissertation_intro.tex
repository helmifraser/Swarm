\section{Relevance}

From an engineering perspective, mimicking natural systems could provide better solutions to a multitude of problems across various industries. One way that is gaining major interest from academics and the industry alike is the application of swarm robotics.

Swarm robotics is a relatively new field of multi-robotics, in which the aim is to co-ordinate a large number of robots in a decentralized manner, similar to biological systems found in nature. This can be applied to any problem that would benefit from having multiple agents solving it, such as search and rescue, subsea and space exploration and autonomous vehicles. In order to carry out this project, a thorough understanding of the concepts and mechanisms that underpin swarm robotics systems will need to be achieved, as well as a strong working understanding of various tools used in their implementation such as simulation software and higher level programming.
